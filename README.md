# I am ignoring the following files that will be stored in my utah_lake folder
*.jpg
*.docx

# anything to do with R
*.Rhistory
/.Rproj.user/

# these are all generic things right now bc I don't have my actual data set yet nor any work completed for it
# I am working on finding a data set of the water levels and water quality that is specific to my research plots
# on the north side of utah lake. I want to analyze that data to try to find trends, or just to show empirically
# that there aren't any trends and it's chaotic hahah
