Asclepias incarnata,swamp milkweed,x,,OBL,perennial,,"Once they are dry, place the seeds into plastic bags filled with moist perlite or vermiculite and store them in a cold place, approximately 35 to 38 degrees Fahrenheit, for at least 4 to 12 weeks (stratification). Good germination results have been reported without stratification by soaking the seed. Soak the seed in hot water (190 degrees Fahrenheit) for 12 hours. Repeat this process two additional times for expected seed germination of 50%. Seed can be placed in cold storage for up to three years.",scarification,https://plants.usda.gov/factsheet/pdf/fs_asin.pdf,Mindy,
Asclepias speciosa,showy milkweed,x,,FAC,perennial,,requires a cold stratification treatment for germination; however seed collections in southeast Idaho and central California germinated at IDPMC did not require any stratification for full germination,scarification,https://plants.usda.gov/plantguide/pdf/pg_assp.pdf,Mindy & WERL,"Aberdeen PMC grows showy milkweed in 10 ci conetainers, by sowing approximately 5 seeds/cone covered lightly with gravel. Stratification has not been necessary for adequate germination. Soil is kept moist via overhead misting during the germination period"
